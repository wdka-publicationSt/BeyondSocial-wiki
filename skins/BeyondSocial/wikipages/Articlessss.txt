|Summary=The proposal deals with the city and its architecture in the form of participatory engagement

with three large machines. The public is involved with creating and interpreting architecture in its broad social, cultural, and historical perspective. The three machines propose a fundamental recollection and a retrieval of the historical destiny of architecture; a singular, if unexpected, homecoming. This mechanism constitutes a single project: Each segment forms a starting point for the understanding and functioning of the others. Together they form a cycle in which projects are seen, explicated, and overcome. As metaphysical equipment the three machines and their respective architectures seek to release each of the future sites unto themselves, thus letting the present remain a given, even as it moves toward its own past.

|Article===Lesson A:==

Reading Architecture Teaches an almost forgotten (medieval) process of building, a process that is in its own way not yet fully unfolded in architecture. Like the medieval monastery out of which the Reading Machine l emerged, the method of construction and the technique of understanding bring about a revolution of architecture’s techne, which coincides with the movement of the text that it propels. As a place of intersection between archaeological reconstruction (Ramelli, Palmanova, military engineering) and the will to power it discloses (metaphysics, monasticism, ideology), the Reading Machine reveals the tautological reality of the architectural text. The Eight Books-each a single word uttered by the forgetfulness of being that resolves itself by turning back in order to come forward-lie on eight shelves. The books come and go for a comparison not only with each other, but with the weight of the last seven words of metaphysics, which crush the gears and axles whose relation is inaccessible from the reading position. The wheel revolves, and in compelling a revolution returns to its starting point while exposing its own uselessness and kinetic beauty. _ Executed in a “medieval” manner, with glueless joints and using no energy of contemporary kind, this machine represents the triumph of spirit over matter, of candlelight over darkness. It is made solely from wood, as are the books.

==Lesson B:==

Remembering Architecture Consists of that which can still be remembered in architecture. As a historical program the sites have been filtered through Giulio Camillo’s Memory Theater. As a precise weaving of the memory tradition with the agony of a deus ex machina, this theater represents the workings of a Renaissance mind and shows its internal equipment and the arrangement it reveals. _ The Memory Machine2 consists of the backstage only-the spectacle takes place wholly outside of it. As a mechanism for projection, concealment, and illusion, this prosthetic piece of equipment exposes and hides the Venetian projects.

Since the process of its construction remains in the classical arena (imagination, measurement, idea), the subversive element of mechanics (Teatro Farnese versus Teatro Olimpico) enters only in those places where memory has succeeded in retaining its surrogate authority. – As a ghost of humanism’s cosmic hubris, the Memory Machine seeks to disengage the sites from the Earth in order to return them to their original, destined locus: Joyce’s Dublin and Tatlin’s Moscow. _ Done in a Renaissance style of being, the Memory Machine abounds in the kind of inventiveness and caprice that we associate with the Odradek. – It is executed in wood and retains in its structure the “hanging papers” seen by the king. This project represents the stage of architecture’s appearance and is a testament to its own manifestation. Also made of wood are the eighteen subordinate spectacles, which include the “cloud machine” and the “schizophrenic forum.” Colorless: The bloody red illuminates the shiny exterior of an inner sanctum dedicated to what remains nameless. Metal is used exclusively for non structural reasons, related as it is to light itself. Ropes are used throughout.

==Lesson C:==

Writing Architecture Teaches the artless and science less making of architecture. As a fully engaged project this machine industrializes the poetic of architecture and offers it as a sacrifice to its own possibilities of making a text. Architecture, like shoemaking, becomes a problem of putting the nail in the right place. _ Since the Writing Machine3 processes both memory and reading material, it takes what is projected into an exact account. Not only the city itself (Palmanova) but all places written into the book of culture as here collected and disposed. _ Through an enlightened vision the random mosaic of knowledge is gathered together into seven times seven faces, each mirrored in a quadripartite realm. The totality of architecture is shattered by the foursome reciprocity of Earth, sky, mortals, and gods, and lies open to a contemporary stocktaking. _ The four sides of this “Orphic” calculator, or probability computer, prognosticate the written destiny of architecture, whose oblivion is closely associated with Victor Hugo’s prophecy. The four-sided cubes work in the following Swiftian manner:

* Side I: The City as a Star of Redemption is refracted and congeals into a “boogie-woogie” constellation.
* Side 2: Is a metalliC reflection that shatters and disrupts the spatial-mathematical order of the forty-nine times four sides.
* Side 3: Consists of a geometric sign, which points to a graphic omen or architectural horoscope.
* Side 4: Enumerates the forty-nine saints who accompany the detached pilgrim in order to care for his unerasable vulnerability.

|Summary=Introducing sustainability as a theme in art and design education comes with a set of unique challenges. Sustainability encompasses a vast number of topics. The word is used in very different contexts, ranging from political programmes to marketing of consumer goods, and therefore has become an almost meaningless term. During the Minor Sustainability, as part of the Social Practices graduation profile at the Willem De Kooning Academy in Rotterdam, we introduce what sustainability encompasses in general, but more specifically how students can use it to respond to what is happening around them. The minor also serves to learn and test relevant methodologies for exploring and analysing the context. The most important methodologies are discussed below.
|Article=== Systems thinking == 
Too often a 'quick design fix' turns out to be counterproductive within a sustainable design practice. One of the most important concepts we introduce to students is that sustainability is not only related to the properties of an object, but to the state of a system. This way, statements such as 'this product is sustainable because I used a biodegradable plastic' can easily be disproven. Not only the material matters, but even more how an object is used and how it affects the larger system in which it exists. Perhaps the biodegradable object is used as a container for a toxic pesticide, perhaps as a low-cost tool to filter polluted drinking water. The same material can have a totally different impact according to its use. Thinking in systems is therefore a powerful skill for students aiming to make a meaningful change within their art and design practice as well as larger global systems. 

== Interdisciplinary teams == 
Systems thinking can be explained as a way of looking at the man-made world as an ecosystem. Instead of chopping up a situation into pieces and studying the individual parts, an analysis is made of how the different parts influence and relate to each other. Within system thinking, the belief is held that different players thrive or fail depending on how they work together and respond to each other following complex paths of behaviour. In practice it means that students work in interdisciplinary teams, and investigate other professional fields such as technology, biology and sociology, placing their practice in relation to these sciences. They are assessing the impact of their work on others, not only close by and directly, but also further away and in the long run. This leads to a different formulation of their assignments and as a consequence we see students becoming facilitators, storytellers, crowdfunders, data analysts and entrepreneurs. Sometimes students can become overwhelmed and discouraged; the systemic approach risks making a problem more abstract which makes it more difficult to act. Therefore it is important that students link the newly acquired knowledge back to the reality of everyday life, to apply it to a locality. 

== Mapping a locality == 
During the Minor Sustainability, students work in an assigned area, such as a neighbourhood or district. They build their temporary studios and work on-site. To understand the area and to unravel the complex systems that are in place, students are asked to make mappings. These mappings, geographical or relational, show where resources and waste are located or how people in the community are connected. Mapping is a method for making layers of information about an area tangible, allowing students to identify points of intervention where their impact can be substantial. Therefore, students often do not design something new from scratch but respond to what is already in place and use resources locally available. 

== Connecting with stakeholders == 
Students are asked to involve stakeholders in their project from an early phase onwards. Experts, partners or users are an important source of information at the start of a project. In a later phase they can be involved to test a prototype, give feedback, link to relevant other parties or become an active partner to take a project further. By involving stakeholders closely in their projects, students are constantly forced to test the relevance of their own work. Questions arise such as: Is the problem I am addressing really felt by the community? Are other companies working on the same topic? How could my product or service best be implemented? This way of working is not only enriching, it also leads to an attitude of collaboration instead of competition. 

== Embedded Research ==
Embedded research methods are used to connect with stakeholders. Instead of handing out questionnaires, the students aim to engage people with a spatial intervention, a performance, a game or a hoax. By using these strategies we can see the type of response as honest and especially valuable when linked to other data required by literature reviews and mapping. 

== Prototyping == 
In the final phase of the design process, student concepts are translated into a visual form. Some students might create conversation pieces; others choose to develop working prototypes for consumer goods. Even though their visuals should be largely self-explanatory, we always ask students to present their physical or digital work as a smaller part of a larger whole. Final presentations are accompanied by websites, posters or other visual materials showing the network of the projects and how they positively influence different parts of a dynamic system. 

== RAID and Microbial Energy: two inspiring examples ==
We would like to introduce two successful projects that came out of the fourth module of the Minor Sustainability. The fashion collection RAID is designed to be timeless, as a response to the endlessly changing fashion industry. At the same time, locally available waste fabric was used to make the garments and a collaboration with a social workshop was established. The same sophistication can be found in the Microbial Energy project, which combined technology for obtaining energy from a biological source with the possibility of cleaning the Rotterdam harbour waters while floating in an off-grid house. These two projects very well represent the level of impact and interconnectedness which we aim for in the Minor Sustainability.

|Summary='''How to create a Critical Diversity Literate Art School, in which students and teachers of all cultural and ethnic backgrounds, genders, sexualities and (dis)abilities feel treated with equity and are supported to explore their full potential? This is the question at the heart of, and one of the main goals of, the project 'Brown Bag Lunch' (BBL) presented by WdKA Makes a Difference. We are thus interested in rethinking pedagogy, in increasingly diverse learning environments within the Rotterdam University of Applied Sciences, through various programmes and methods. Our concern as educational professionals is that traditional academic environments are inadequate in serving this diverse body of students. In response we decided to create a space for interested teachers in which informal academic exchanges could occur.'''
|Article=<small>Author: Teana Boston-Mammah and Nana Adusei-Poku</small>
 
== Inclusive Pedagogy ==
In September 2015 we organised the first in our series of Brown Bag Lunches. We began by discussing an article by Frank Tuitt on 'Realizing a More Inclusive Pedagogy'. Tuitt proposes 'a variety of pedagogical models that focus on the education of the whole individual – that is, the union of the mind, body, and soul of human beings.' (Tuitt 2003, 243). 'Inclusive Pedagogy' is a form of Pedagogy which advocates teaching practices that embrace the whole student in the learning process. Learning and collaborating at the boundaries and intersections of different educational backgrounds and levels, disciplines, genders, ages, interests, etc. are issues recognised by all teachers in the group.
As practitioners we feel the need to be self-aware, particularly asking the questions: who are we? and: who are our students? Are we facilitators, transformative educators or providers, serving pre-framed knowledges and practices?

== Storytelling ==
Narratology, one of the many models reviewed by Tuitt, appeared to be a compelling method. Teachers were keen to explore how personal narratives could promote critical thinking by using students' personal narratives to appraise the canons of knowledge used in our various educational settings. This method could also be used to increase awareness of wider systemic power structures. In this way the stories become de-personalised and rather represent a framework for critical reflection and possibly reveal aspects of shared experiences amongst dominant and marginalised groups in the learning environment, thus enabling the development of (self-)critical awareness in everyday life. 

However, in our discussions teachers also expressed caution in engaging students in this way, as it puts more pressure on teachers to manage emotional slippages and possible discontent among other students who may prioritise more formal knowledge streams, as well as concern for the students who speak out about their experiences as part of marginalised groups. While seeing this as a valuable experiential resource for themselves and others, it can also leave students exposed and vulnerable, running the risk of becoming a spectacle for students belonging to more dominant (hence less vulnerable) groups. It is thus intrinsic to hear the dominant group's reflections and opinions in order to analyse their contributions equally. In this way students can also be encouraged to contribute to the construction of knowledge and classroom dynamics. 
Teachers felt that they too could harness their own personal narratives in the learning environment, at the beginning of each new course, so that students have a better understanding of who they are. This also allows us to think through which aspects of our identity students would perceive as important and that are thus related to, or influence, the way we teach. Such sharing can be a form of pushing, i.e. making students do connecting work whereby the diversity of the reactions elicited by the teacher's narrative can be used to help students learn about competing narratives and analyses.

== Contradictions ==
'We are working and living in an emotional environment – but the school constructs itself as rational,' one WdKA teacher mentioned.  Owing to a concern with the contradictory nature of this observation, teachers are apprehensive of such approaches being perceived as replacement therapy sessions, while nevertheless agreeing that it is invaluable to raise awareness of the notion of differences in 'speaking positions'. An important remark during this discussion focused on the concept of emotional safety in the classroom, with teachers finding it important to distinguish between empathy and sharing on one hand and friendship on the other. Employing these kinds of practices does not mean that 'everybody leaves as friends'. A desired framing is one that prioritises transparency, in other words to address the power structures which our Bodies reproduce in a classroom setting, and to be able as professionals to discuss and reflect on these power structures with the group. 

== Conclusions ==
While there was a general agreement that Inclusive Pedagogy offers many valuable tools and insights for further development, there was also a realisation that many teachers would not only lack the confidence to embrace such an approach, but also do not necessarily see it as part of their professional (cognitive, task-driven) imperative. However those teachers participating in the BBL, which is a racially and culturally diverse group, who embraced Narratology and apply it in the pedagogical approach, face different responses by students which are often forms of personalised projections on the teachers' Bodies. White teachers are often confronted by students with remarks such as 'who are you to address the issue of power and race', which white teachers said make it difficult for them to respond. In the BBL group we agreed that there are no universally correct answers for these questions, but that it was important to try to understand and reflect upon each critical (and sometimes painful) comment.

The BBL has proven to be an opportunity to not only support teachers who are committed to bringing social change to the ways in which we teach, but also has become an invaluable resource for us as researchers to develop strategies and methods for creating more awareness of the power structures that are reproduced in our classrooms.

|Summary=“Stop Telling Women to Smile is an art series by Tatyana Fazlalizadeh. The work attempts to address gender based street harassment by placing drawn portraits of women, composed with captions that speak directly to offenders, outside in public spaces.”
|Article=The project ‘Stop Telling Women to Smile” is still an ongoing project. The series travels through different states and even countries. This is what makes the project very transformative and participatory. It can be used for different women who have had different experiences. And it gives all these women their own voice. Tatyana Fazladizadeh takes women’s values and faces, and puts them in the street. By that, she creates a presence in the places where they feel unsafe.

The starting point of this project is very artistic, using the portraits of the woman as main focus. The artistic level stops right there. Although it is an ongoing project that is traveling the world, maybe there could be more time spent on how to evolve the posters she is putting around. Maybe the black and white posters work very well in one neighbourhood, but are totally ignored in the other neighbourhood. She could have looked more at the different types of colouring and printing. 

Never the less, I think this is a very good social art & design project. Many women feel objectified and demoralized every day, even here in Rotterdam. But we all take this behaviour for granted as normal and acceptable. Laura S. Logan, an assistant professor of sociology at Hastings College in Nebraska, who has studied catcalling for years says that research shows that is a problem affecting how women get to work, when they go out and how they dress. 
We’re being shown for the impact it actually has on us and Tatyana is helping to make it stop and create more awareness for women to stand up for themselves. Women’s bodies are consumed and are considered public property for display, comment and consumption. Another reason I think this is a very good project is that it gives women a face. And by giving them a face, other women can faster relate to their problems and by that feel more encouraged to stand up for them selves whenever they feel harassed. It makes them feel that is isn’t normal, and that it is okay to participate in the fight against this harassments.  

However, I do see some weak aspects of the project. I think it could be better, but better by many different little things. The overall context of the project is really good, but it needs to be more detailed. For example, by drawing them they characterise the women. I think this is why men won’t take it serious enough. They don’t see them as an example for a real woman. They also don’t look angry or sad enough. And that may seem as an irrelevant thing, but the human being simply need to literally see the sadness or anger on someone’s face, otherwise they think that they aren’t sad or angry enough to see it as a real problem. This is why men are still a thread for the project. It is all up to them to see this project as a relevant thing. And I don’t know if only posters on the wall can accomplish this. They’ll probably see it and don’t feel addressed at all. 

But, where there are threads and weak aspects, there also lies opportunity’s. Why not make different STPTS Teams all over the world who can give this project more attention all over the world. So, for example, why not make a Rotterdam STPTS Team who can photograph the different faces of Rotterdam women who are harassed every single day. Display their faces on a huge A0 poster and put it out on the streets and neighbourhoods where they feel uncomfortable? When this project lives to it’s full potential, it can change the world. It can change the way men objectify women. 

Finally, to end my review in a way of recommendation. Encouraging conversations between men and women about street harassment and how it affects women physically, mentally and emotionally stays difficult, but if Tatyana gives her women more identity by adding colour and more facial expression the message will get more noticed and become more powerful.

|Image=Mother Earth Network Projection on plants.jpg
|Caption=Mother Earth Network Projection on plants
|Category=Projects
|Summary=My name is Elise Marcus and I call myself a sustainable mindset designer. I strongly believe that we have to break our old cultural mindset down in order to live sustainable. 
In our current cultural mindset we are placing our self-made systems above the ecosystem. We are no longer listening to what mother earth is telling us. This project can be a first step for us, to create a culture in which the ecosystem is the most important system. This could be possible if we would translate the needs of the ecosystem into our own language. Resulting in the situation where everything we will create from now on, will be submissive to mother earth.
|Article=The Mother Earth Network is a concept about creating an artificial intelligence of our planet. Data that has been collected by citizens and scientists will be uploaded into one big network: the mother earth network. After which it will be translated into a human-like story by an artificial intelligence of mother earth. This way, the user of the Mother Earth Network can get in direct contact with his or her surroundings. For example the soil in the park or the tree in their backyard. 

Mother Earth Network will be a way for people to communicate, listen en feel empathy for our planet. By feeling connected with your surroundings, you will be intrinsically motivated to live in a more sustainable way. 
The project is based on scientific facts, mixed with imagination and vision. My research is build up of five questions, which I explain in the research document: Why, Where to, How, What and Who. During my research I had a lot of knowledge from the external partners at the Rijks Instituut voor Volksgezondheid and the RWTH; a geological research institute in Aken, Germany.
Below you’ll find a summery of the five questions of my report:

In '''Chapter one''' I research the reason why humans act in a non-sustainable way. In this chapter you can read the essence of the research. I conclude four cultural factors that may be responsible for non-sustainable behavior. These factors are based on various psychological researches. Factor 1: Not believing you have any impact, 2 Making a higher power or authority responsible for our actions, 3 not feeling connected with our planet and direct surroundings, 4 the believe that humans are only capable of destructive behavior. I concluded that humans have a cultural low self-esteem that needs to be changed. Only if we change our current cultural mindsets, we can live completely sustainable.

In '''Chapter two''',  the question that is answered is: Which upcoming technologies have a huge impact and how can we use these technologies to create more connectedness with the earth? I concluded that upcoming technologies like artificial intelligence and Internet of things must be of surface of the ecosystem.

'''In Chapter three''' will be discussed how a cultural mindset can be changed. After reading various psychological and environmental researches and talked to several professors on this topic, I’ve concluded four methods to change the cultural mindset; Network, Intrinsic motivation, knowledge and Empathy. These methods have become essential for the outcome of this project.

'''Chapter four''' is the conclusion of the research. I explain the theories of previous chapters and how they are processed in the concept of Mother Earth Network. All over the world, citizens can participate in this project by collecting data with the Data Collection Kit. The more people join the network, the more complete the digital version will become. This project is created in a way that it could already work in 2017/2018 on a really basic level, but will be on its full potential around 2022.

In '''Chapter five''' I discus the target group. The question answered here is who will be the first target group to start the project and make it more popular? Who will be the target group this project first has to focus on? The target group will be the early adapters from age 18 till 28, with an already visible environment identity. This project will enhance their identity and biospheric values. Research has shown that when the biospheric values are enhanced, people will feel more connected with the earth and act more sustainable.
This project has had an enormous impact on me as a designer and my future plans. I believe that this project can become a first step to change our cultural mindset. I have come to see that my role as a sustainable mindset designer is to create a visual language on which one can build upon in future projects. I strive to realize this project after my graduation. My dream is to live in a world, which all the human-made systems will eventually be submissive to the ecosystem. A world where we feel connected with mother earth, physically and digitally.

|Category=Project
|Summary=Let's PLAY: An educative toolset for design students based on the theory of playfulness, by [http://www.lisannemeester.nl Lisanne Meester]
|Article==== Research ===

===== Motivation =====
From my interest for playfulness as a method and my experiences with design education I started a more thorough research into these topics. I decided to search for a way to use this playfulness as a tool for design students for the moments they get stuck, to in the end enable them to become the creative thinkers we need nowadays. 
This lead to the following research question: How can playfulness be a tool for design students at moments of feeling blocked in creating?

===== Conclusion =====
The answer to this question is as follows: Playfulness can be a tool for design students at moments of feeling blocked in creating by using the action of play. This conclusion mainly resulted from discovering there is a difference between play and playfulness. Play is an action and playfulness is an attitude. This attitude may well be one of the most important skills for designers to have, but along the way I realised it is something which must first be learned. This is exactly what I aim to use the action of play for. By letting students play I want them to naturally gain this attitude of playfulness.

The discoveries in this research eventually lead to the project 'Let's PLAY'

=== About the project ===
[[File:Let's_PLAY_Lisanne_Meester.jpg|thumb|Let's PLAY]]

Let's PLAY is an educative toolset for design students which can be used at moments of feeling blocked in creating. The action of play, accommodated by this toolbox, is specifically used outside of the design process. Stepping away from this captivating process and play for a moment will help students to loosen their mind and unconsciously gain creative insights they can then take back into their design process again. 

The toolbox contains 18 carefully designed objects to play with. These objects will have the ultimate impact on the state of mind of design students in combination with the designed playground and given challenges, which are quite abstract, but do have a second design related layer.

This complete package of objects, playground and challenges is a new tool for self-education, which connects to the current demand within design education and supports the importance of designers nowadays. By performing the action of play the user of this toolset will eventually adopt a very personal attitude of playfulness, an extremely powerful attitude for any designer to have.

|Summary=There is never just one red flag, there are however a lot of little pink ones that together can make a real impact on a child.
|Article=== Shutters ==
I started this project because I was looking for a relevant subject for this day and age.

We always talk about the outcome of indoctrination; “My life in a cult” or the latest terrorist attack. We never talk about the process.

In this animation short I want to show the subtle ways of childhood indoctrination. 

In many cases parents don’t indoctrinate their children because they hate them, it’s the opposite. 

They just want the best for the kids by bringing them up with their theology or world view. They are doing it out of love. The process of indoctrination is hard to see on the outside. 

There is never just one red flag, there are however a lot of little pink ones that together can make a real impact on a child.

|Summary=Many Facebook-users regularly have to deal with frustrations that are related to Facebook posts. Usually there is nothing you can do about it: you inevitably become friends with people on Facebook who will sometimes post things that you find annoying.
|Article=In the virtual reality game Facebook Therapy VR, it is possible to release your frustrations physically and anonymously, without having to offend your friends in real life (or punching your screen).

In Facebook Therapy VR, it is ultimately not the type of Facebook posts that are important. Instead, it all comes down to the frustration itself and how players express themselves in the game. Through this frustration I want to make players aware of the emotional influence Facebook has on their life and also to make them stop and think about how and why they are frustrated with content on Facebook.

 "[It] makes you think about whether you don't do it yourself as well... posting useless things." - Tessie

 "What this game does, it facilitates me to do something I could never do." - Yoshi

 "[Destroying Facebook posts in the game] is very fun, it gives you a good feeling. Especially with all the explosions and the music, that works really well." - Jorrit
